API building exercise

## Install Go
Before running the api please make sure you have Go installed.
https://golang.org/doc/install

## Clone the repo
You can clone the repo using `git clone` or `go get`.

I prefer using the latter since it clones the repo into the go folder structure for you.

## Buiding, Testing and Running
Use makefile commands to get things working:

Command | Description
------------ | -------------
`make build` | Build the API
`make test` | Run all automated tests
`make run` | Run the API
